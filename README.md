Security is essential because it helps to ensure that an organization can continue to exist and operate despite any attempts to steal its data or compromise its physical or logical elements.

Security is the business management tool that ensures the reliable and protected operation of IT/IS.

There are three common types of security evaluation: risk assessment, vulnerability assessment, and penetration testing.

Risk assessment is identifying assets, threats, and vulnerabilities to calculate risk. Once risk is understood, it is used to guide the improvement of the existing security infrastructure. 

Vulnerability assessment uses automated tools to locate known security weaknesses, which can be addressed by adding more defenses or adjusting the current protections. 

Penetration testing uses trusted teams to stress-test the security infrastructure to find issues that may not be discovered by the prior two means and to find those concerns before an adversary takes advantage of them.

Security management concepts and principles are inherent elements in a security policy and solution deployment. They define the basic parameters needed for a secure environment. They also define the goals and objectives that both policy designers and system implementers must achieve to create a secure solution.

The 5 Pillars of Information Security are confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity, and nonrepudiation.

Confidentiality is the concept of the measures used to ensure the protection of the secrecy of data, objects, or resources.

Confidentiality protections prevent disclosure while protecting authorized access.

- Many instances of unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information are the result of human error, oversight, or ineptitude. 
- Confidentiality violations can result from either end users or actions from a Systems Administrator. 
- They can also occur because of an oversight in a security policy or a misconfigured security control. 

Numerous countermeasures can help ensure confidentiality against possible threats, such as: encryption, network traffic padding, strict access control, rigorous authentication procedures, data classification, and extensive personnel training.

Concepts, conditions, and aspects of confidentiality include the following:
Sensitivity - sensitivity refers to the quality of information that could cause harm of damage if disclosed. 

Discretion - discretion is a decision where an operator can influence or control disclosure to minimize harm or damage.

Criticality - the level to which information is mission critical is its measure of criticality.

Concealment - concealment is the act of hiding or preventing disclosure. Concealment is often viewed as a means of cover, obfuscation, or distraction. A related concept to concealment is security through obscurity, which attempts to gain protection through hiding, silence, and secrecy.

Secrecy - Secrecy is the act of keeping something a secret or preventing the disclosure of information. 

Privacy - Privacy refers to keeping information confidential that is personally identifiable or that might cause harm, embarrassment, or disgrace to someone if revealed.

Seclusion - Seclusion involves storing something in an out-of-the-way location, likely with strict access controls.

Isolation - Isolation is the act of keeping something separated from others.
